\section*{Outline and Marking}

\large
In this course, we will cover the basics of using the \texttt{R} programming language, along with simple plotting, data organization, and programming techniques. We will also cover the fundamentals of linear modeling before moving onto generalized linear modeling (non-normal distributions), mixed models (i.e. \textit{random effects}), spatio-temporal effects. Finally, we will discuss how to write about statistical analysis, and will end with short presentations on an analysis of your own datasets (or a simulated dataset, if you haven't collected data yet).

Proposed marking scheme:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Class participation: 25\%
  \item Final project ``peer review": 25\%
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Create a draft write-up, and provide feedback on your colleagues' work
    \item Write a review document to send to the editor (SR)
  \end{itemize}
  \item Final project write-up: 25\%
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Respond to the feedback from your colleagues, and write a response letter
  \end{itemize}
  \item Final project presentation: 25\%
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Mock committee/proposal meeting: ``what are your main results so far?"
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
