## Motivation

- Translating Model Results
- IMRaD Papers
- Figures and Tables
- Practice!

## Where do I start?

- You've finished fitting your models, and the results make sense to you, but...
- How do I translate all these numbers into ``real" English?
- Where do I put all these numbers in the paper?
- Do I need figures and tables?

## Answer: "It depends"

\textsc{What is your story?}
\vspace{1em}

\textsc{Who is your audience?}
\vspace{1em}

- How do these numbers serve the questions I'm asking?
- Do these numbers help my audience to understand what I found?
- Would figures or tables help to prove my point more concisely or easily?
- How do these numbers relate to the rest of the literature?

Show the _bare minimum_ number of statistics needed to convince people. If it's not relevant to your story, move it somewhere else.

## Models as reflections of reality

::: columns

:::: column

- Models are meant to reflect an underlying process
- Things like effect size (mean/SE) reflect the relative strength of the factors involved
- Things like $R^2$ reflect how well the model fits the data _overall_
- Causality is implied, but has to be justified

\vspace{1em}
"Keep your eye on the biology!" 

::::

:::: column

```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=5} 
ggplot(d1,aes(x,y1))+geom_point() + labs(x='Forest cover (%)',y='Bat counts') + 
  geom_smooth(method='lm',formula=y~x)
```
What might the underlying physical process be here?

## Models as evidence for arguments

- Scientific discourse can be thought of as a series of logical arguments
- When making an argument, you bring evidence to support your claims
- We use experiments/observations, mathematics, and previous literature to support our claims
- Models act as a _form of evidence_, translating raw data into "ammunition" for your claim

## Example arguments:

::: columns

:::: column

Example 1:

- Premise 1: Bats eat bugs
- Premise 2: Forests have lots of bugs
- Claim: Therefore, bats should prefer forests \footnotemark
- Evidence: The model of my data __supports this claim__ 
- Conclusion: This means that our understanding of bugs, bats, and forests is pretty good

::::

:::: column

Example 2:

- Premise 1: Bats eat bugs
- Premise 2: Forests have lots of bugs
- Claim: Therefore, bats should prefer forests
- Evidence: The model of my data __does not support this claim__
- Conclusion: Either one of these premises is wrong, or we left one out \footnotemark

\footnotetext[1]{Inductive reasoning}
\footnotetext[2]{Or my model is wrong or the data are weird somehow}

## Evidence type 1: coefficients

::: columns

:::: column

- Slopes and intercepts have physical interpretations
  - Intercept: How many bats at 0 % forest?
  - Slope\footnotemark: + 1 % forest = + 1 bat
- Interpretation can be:
  - Yes/no: "Is there any relationship?"
  - Directional: "Is the relationship positive?"
  - Magnitude: "How big is the slope?"
  
:::: 

:::: column

```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=5} 
ggplot(d1,aes(x,y1))+geom_point() + labs(x='Forest cover (%)',y='Bat counts') + 
  geom_smooth(method='lm',se=FALSE,formula=y~x)
```

::::

:::

\footnotetext{For GLMs, slopes are in log or log-odds (logit) units}

## Evidence type 2: variance

::: columns

:::: column

- Variance has a physical interpretation
  - What is the variation in bat counts at a given level of forest?
- $R^2$ relates actual to modelled variance: what % of variance does your model explain?
- GLMs: different distributions model variance differently
- Hierarchical models deal with many levels of variance

::::

:::: column

```{r, warning = FALSE, fig.width=5, fig.height=5} 
ggplot(d1,aes(x,y1))+geom_point() + labs(x='Forest cover (%)',y='Bat counts') + 
  geom_ribbon(data=data.frame(d1, predict(lm(y1~x,data=d1), interval = "confidence")),
              aes(x=x,ymax=upr,ymin=lwr),alpha=0.2)+
  geom_ribbon(data=data.frame(d1, predict(lm(y1~x,data=d1), interval = "prediction")),
              aes(x=x,ymax=upr,ymin=lwr),alpha=0.1)
```

## IMRaD Paper Structure

::: columns

:::: column

![](heard2016_adapted.png)

::::

:::: column

- Most scientific papers follow the IMRaD canon
- Allows the reader to quickly assess whether this paper is useful and skip to important sections only
- Generally, statistics are discussed in the _Methods_ and _Results_ sections only

## Introduction

_I find this section the trickiest to write, so I usually write it last._

- Set up your research question, using the literature
  - Moves from general ("Animals need food") to specific premises ("Bats need bugs") 
- Establish the _knowledge gap_ that your research will address
  - "Forest have lots of bugs, but nobody has checked whether there are bats there too!"
- Last paragraph: strong statement that sums up what you're expecting to see
  - "Bats eat bugs, and forests have lots of bugs. Therefore, bats should prefer forests."
  
## Methods

_I usually write this section first, as it gets me "warmed up" for the rest of it._\footnote{You can even write it before you collect your data!}

- Establish how you collected the data, and how you analyzed it
  - This defends against criticism of your model or your data, and makes your results more believable
- The detail you use depends how "unusual" your model is, which depends on your audience
- Clarify what the dependent, independent variables, and random effects in your models are
- Sometimes you can just use the actual R model formula:
  -  "I fit the model using `lme4` in R using the following model structure for bat counts (while accounting for frogs and unicorns):"

\small

`lmer(batCounts ~ forest + frogs + unicorns + (1|site))`

## Results

_I write this section after I write the Methods section_

- Brief summary of what you collected\footnote{Can sometimes go at the end of the Methods}
  - "I caught 420 bats at my 69 sampling sites."
- Present your results as an answer to the questions that you posed in the Introduction. 
  - "Forest cover caused an increase of 3 bats for each 10% of forest (p>0.001), while frogs had no effect (p=0.7)"
  - Try to keep the language as normal and direct as possible 
  - Having tons of p-values and other numbers can make the text hard to read
- If something weird happened, just say it and move on. Speculate on _why_ in the Discussion.
  - "Surprisingly, unicorns had a negative effect on bat counts."
  
## Discussion

_I write this after my model Results. Here you can name-drop all the relevant papers you've read._

- Relate your results to your research question. Did your results match your expectations?
- Move from specific ("Bats need bugs") to general ("Animals need food"); opposite of the Introduction
- Put the Results you found into the context of the rest of the literature.  If your results contradict other studies, why do you think that occurred?
  - "Barclay et al. (2017) showed that bats don't like forests, but our results may differ because..."
- \textbf{So what?} What new things have we learned? How might this affect theory or practice? Should non-bat people pay attention to this paper?
  
## Figures and Tables

- Figures can be excellent tools for telling your story, but...
  - Figures take up lots of room, cost $ in publications, and can overwhelm the reader if there are too many
  - Many resources for good figure design
- Tables are kind of boring, but are great for conveying lots of numbers at once
  - Useful for showing information on large numbers of coefficients
  - If you have lots of models, `library(broom)` provides summaries of all of them at once

\large
Suggestions:

1. Choose 2 or 3 figures and tables to be the __Main Characters__ in your Results section.
2. Use them to illustrate what your models show. 
3. Move the rest into a supplemental or appendix.

## Final remarks

- Good writing is re-writing
  - I find writing in point form useful, as it lets me hash out the general paragraph and section structure
  - What is obvious to you may not be obvious to your readers. Revision is annoying and painful, but it __will__ help!
  - "[Good writing is:] Telepathy, of course" (Stephen King)
- Use the literature
  - There are tons of poorly-written papers out there, but...
  - Was there a paper that you found easy to understand? Re-read it, and figure out why!
  - Check out how other scientists display their statistics, and imitate/avoid their style
- Use your supervisor and committee members 
  - They have a much wider picture of the field, and have lots of writing and editing experience
  - This means that they can be a good stand-in for your audience
  
Remember: \textsc{Good writing is good storytelling}

## Practice

\large
Pull up a blank text document. Using a model that you have fit to some data, write:

- Description of your research question for the Introduction. What do you expect to see, and why?
- Short description of the model for the Methods
- Short summary of what the model is telling you for the Results 

Point form is fine, but try to find important points that you could convert into topic sentences in an actual paragraph
