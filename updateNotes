Notes for updating lectures:
* Oct 1, 2020: Intro to R lecture
  - Too long, took ~40 mins
  - First problem was fine, 2nd one probably too advanced (unless more examples shown)
  - Try to focus on _immediately_ practical techniques; programming must be immediately useful
  - Things to cut:
    - Lists (probably not necessary here)
    - Matrices (move to Lecture 2)
    - Motivation could take 1/2 time or less
    - Object/Function could be trimmed
  - Things to add:
    - Example re: working directory for reading csv files
    - Replacement example (i.e. how do I replace value x in column y?)
* Oct 8, 2020: Linear models lecture 1
  - OK length, took ~30 mins
  - Qs: how do we do this for 3+ variables? (Answer next week)
  - Talk along with bullet points, don't preempt (takes longer)
  - Exercise was OK, but make sure everyone is keeping up
* Oct 15, 2020: Linear models lecture 2
  - OK time, took ~30 mins
  - Consider better example for independent effects example:
    - "a"
  - Consider better example for effects plot: maybe show a 3D plot so limits of plotting are clear?
  - Should show ANOVA or glht here?
* Oct 23, 2020: Model validation
  - A bit too long, 35-40 mins
  - Could probably chop out reference to GLMs (not necessary yet?)
* Oct 29, 2020: ggplot
  - OK time, about 30 mins
  - Might help to have staged exercises in the future (ie. learn a bit, code a bit, repeat), or even split into 2 lectures, simply due to the hierarchical nature of ggplot
  - People were VERY interested in maps! Future lecture?
* Nov 5, 2020: dplyr/tidyr
  - Took longer, maybe 50 mins in total. Probably should just plan for a longer time period, since the material is fairly heirarchical.
  - Mini-exercises are good, but probably could be shorter and more compact if done in a lecture (would be OK as lab exercises, though)
  - Live code demos would be good, esp. for multi-line pipes (hard to see what's going on in the middle of the pipe)
* Nov 19, 2020: intro to common distributions
  - A bit too long, ~40 mins, but exercise was fairly short
  - "What distribution should I use" exercise was OK, but binomial vs poisson was kind of tricky - remind them about number of trials for binomial
  - Could cut down on math material, and emphasize how the distributions look using different sets of parameters
  - Might help to do live coding demo at the end, since getting generated data into a dataframe is a bit of a stretch for some
  - "Homework" idea: think of some of the things you've measured, and figure out what distribution they might follow. 
* Nov 26, 2020: ML and basic GLM fitting
  - ~30 minutes; felt about right in terms of timing (even with distractions)
  - I haven't taught the t-distribution, but I'm not sure that it's completely necessary right now
  - Partial effects plots were taught ~1 month ago, so review/reminder would be good before assigning them to do it again
    - This would be fine IF dplyr/ggplot were taught at the beginning of the course, rather than in between stats lectures
  - I think this is useful material, as ML will come up later, but...
    - Could also just teach link functions + GLM syntax, and just say that R finds the coefficients "somehow"
* Dec 3, 2020: GLM validation
  - ~40 minutes, but felt OK given that people were showing their homework rather than getting new data to work with
  - Definitely felt like a grab-bag of topics; probably could have been 2 lectures
    - ZI section could have been quicker
  - Also needs:
    - How to use glm.nb, and possibly beta-binomial models
    - Partial effects plots for GLMs
    - Updated, but we'll see how much time these take
* Dec 10, 2020: Mixed effects models
    - ~50 mins, but people asked questions, so probably about 40 mins without Qs
    - Exercise was an OK length, I think
    - Figures showing random effects were helpful. Could probably reduce the math and rely on figures more
    - Might be useful to show a "random effects only" model to demonstrate how variance is partitioned
      - e.g. Mass ~ 1 + (1|Site) -> 2 SD terms
* Dec 17, 2020: Mixed effects models 2
    - ~ 40 mins, OK length
    - 1st section of the lecture was a bit of a grab-bag from last week
      - Code should be made more clear (e.g. Wald Z-test p-values)
    - Spatial random effects was OK, but the concept of variance and covariance is really tricky
      - Work on organization to make the flow better
      - Metaphor: gravity from planets affecting each other; other "field" metaphors? 
    - Might help to show physical example rather than just (mu1, mu2, mu3)
      - e.g. "values collected at 5 sites, here's what the covariance matrix looks like, given rho & sigma"
* Mar 4, 2021: Writing
    - ~ 30 mins, OK length
    - Could streamline mention of the IMRaD paper structure, don't say too much of it beforehand
  
Other ideas:
- Could also do slightly (10 min) longer lecture, then assign "homework"
- Need to mention somewhere that packages need to be re-loaded every time you restart R
- No mention of how to do ANOVA or glht tests in early lectures! 
  - Perhaps this could be a separate lecture: "How to write about stats?"
